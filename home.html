                <p>In 1934, a man stood on a train platform, he was struck by the lack of engaging books available for travellers. It dawned on him that the world needed quality literature at affordable prices. Determined to make a change, he spent the next year bringing his vision to life - In 1935 Penguin was born, igniting a paperback revolution that made high-quality reading accessible to all and transformed the literary world forever.
